Pasqal : Quantum Engineer Use Case
=======================================

This GitHub repository sets up a Quantum Machines' OPX+ to modulate the intensity of a laser beam and read this intensity using an oscilloscope or directly a photodiode.
The documentation can be found in the `docs file <https://github.com/a-corni/Pasqal-Quantum-Engineer-Use-Case/docs>`_, and read using `the read-the-docs of this project <https://readthedocs.org/projects/pasqal-quantum-engineer-use-case/>`_
